## Electronic Health Record


##### Electronic Health card , with storing data with the use of decentralise blockcahin and using ML/DL to process the data.
##### A Decentralised storage where user medical health history will be kept saved and can be used later in future.
##### Our platform provide feature to store past medical records and data  and access them at one place.





#### IFPS



The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a file system protocol based on a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.
In our platform the major part of data is stored on IPFS  and can only be viewed through the hash generated by IPFS.
The data stored is linked to a hash which can then later be used to query the data stored on the file system. 
In our platform, the whole IPFS query model is separated into a node application, which we refer to as an IPFS engine. It consists of three API endpoints:
One that stores text data to the filesystem.
Second is responsible for storing the binary data to the system.
And the final one is responsible that fetch the saved data by using the hashes that we got by the response of the two endpoints we discussed earlier.





#### Three parts of our platform.


###### USER BASE:

User can register and one unique medical id will be generated.User can fill out basic info and upload older medical info. User can view past medical history 

###### Hospital/Physician:
Physician can ask for permission to update medical history using patient unique id (Authorization done with Otp check)Physician can upload Prescription, Lab reports , Diagnose summary etc.The image data will be compressed before saving on database.There will be two portals out there , admin portal and hospital portal.


###### Emergency app:

This service will be optional , user can turn it off whenever they want 
The user app will  generate a QR code
No authorization needed to view the data.
By scanning this QR code, basic info about user will be shown on web app( Identification , past medication, allergies)
In future planning to detect accident by collect high-frequency sensor data from instruments in the  phone and automatically  show QR code on screen.


#### SCHEMA
###### The data will be stored in hash and that will be stored on IFPS.
